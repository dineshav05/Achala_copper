# Achala_copper
Achala Copper is a women-led, eco-wellness initiative based in Bengaluru that blends ancient Indian wisdom with modern sustainable infrastructure.  We design and deploy smart vending machines that offer reusable, 99% pure copper water bottles at public and semi-public places such as hospitals, IT parks, metro stations, and airports.
